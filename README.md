# Vainglory News

This project began with the hope of making a better News tab for Vainglory. It is an automated feed of all the Vainglory news that any player can submit content. Once the editors approve of the content, the website automatically updates with it.

# How It Works

This project is composed of several components to make it work.

1. Website (This repo)
2. Bot that allows users to easily submit content and editors to approve content.
3. Database
4. Discord Server

- Users join the discord server
- Use the **!submit** command that begins a Q&A session getting the necessary information.
- The bot posts the request in #pending-approval channel.
- Editors approve or reject the post after discussion and if approved the bot updates the database and rebuilds the website.

# Features

1. Clean and crisp tabs/navigation of the news tab

- Helps organize content for users to view the content that they want to see.

2. Latest Tab

- Shows the @vainglory and @vainglorystatus twitter feeds
- Shows the official news from the vainglorygame.com (Automatically updated when new posts are made)
- Shows the posts that were marked to be featured by the editing team.

3. Art Tab

- Shows Vainglory art and memes submitted to the site.

4. Guides Tab

- Shows articles that are meant to be teaching players
- Shows videos that are meant to be teaching players

5. Esports Tab

- Shows community tournaments

6. Tools Tab

- Shows the best Vainglory projects that are maintained and are useful to players
